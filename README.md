### Technologies Used: HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/ES6/Git/GitHub/VSCode/MongoDB/MySQL/Figma/FontAwesomeCDN.
This code is a JavaScript Illuastrating a Real Estate Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file contains elements with IDs "numberbox", "slider", "progress-bar", "play-button", "pause-button", "n-queen-board", and "queen-arrangement". These elements are manipulated by JavaScript.

2. **JavaScript Variables**:
   - `numberbox`, `slider`, `progressBar`, `playButton`, `pauseButton`: Variables referencing various HTML elements.
   - `queen`: HTML markup for a chess queen icon.
   - `n`, `speed`, `tempSpeed`, `q`, `Board`: Variables used for controlling the visualization and solving the N-Queens problem.
   - `array`: Pre-calculated number of possible arrangements for different N values.
   - `pos`: Object used to store the state of the boards.
   - `Queen`: Class representing a Queen object with methods to solve the N-Queens problem and visualize the process.

3. **Event Listeners**:
   - `slider.oninput`: Updates the speed of visualization based on slider input.
   - `playButton.onclick`: Initiates the visualization process when the play button is clicked.

5. **Visualize Function**:
   - Triggered when the play button is clicked.
   - Parses input from the number box to set.
   - Clears previous arrangements and boards.
   - Generates HTML elements for the chessboard.
   

This code aims to demonstrate how the N-Queens problem can be solved and visualized using JavaScript, providing insights into the process of finding solutions. It utilizes HTML and CSS for the user interface and JavaScript for the logic and animation.
## The approach followed in this code can be summarized as follows:

User Interface Setup

    HTML and CSS Elements:

Event Handling

    User Interactions:
    JavaScript event listeners are implemented to handle various user actions, such as clicking on the brochure download button, navigating through image galleries, or submitting contact forms.

User Interaction and Feedback

    Input and Feedback Mechanisms:
